                        Hello! My name is Rich Arce. Originally from California, I moved to Arizona for college where I majored in Kinesiology. After graduating, I got a job
                        working at Banner Research where I currently research how neurodegenerative diseases affect the muscular system. My goal is to become better at coding
                        so that I may further my career using my experience in research and new knowledge in programming.
